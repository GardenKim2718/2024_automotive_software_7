Rules for creating & maintaining branches
----------------
1. Create a new branch whenever making major changes within code or adding functions.
2. Set the branch name that can represent the new functionality. (eg: Kalman Filter, Time-to-Collision)
3. Request compare & pull after informing other team mates and it is confirmed that the change is stable.
4. The main branch should be remained as our 'stable' version of our project.
